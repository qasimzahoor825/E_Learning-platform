# E_Learning-platform . My university project was completed with the help of my best friend, Izhan Qureshi. The website features two dashboards: one for students and one for teachers.

In the student dashboard, students can access their lectures, tasks, grades for their relevant subjects, and see notifications about assignment uploads.

In the teacher dashboard, teachers can upload lectures, grade students, assign quizzes, and, at the end of the semester, record results and assign grades to students.
